Our app addresses the challenge of understanding medical terms in blood test reports by utilizing AI to simplify explanations in the user's preferred language, making reports accessible to all. Additionally, it features a chatbot acting as a virtual doctor, providing personalized insights into results. Through advanced algorithms, the chatbot analyzes reports, compares them over time, and highlights improvements or concerning trends. Doctors supervise the dialogue, reviewing chat history when necessary, thus optimizing their time. This innovative approach enhances patient understanding, promotes proactive health management, and streamlines healthcare delivery, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing workload for healthcare providers.
